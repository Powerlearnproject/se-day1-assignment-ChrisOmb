Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
    software engineering is a discipline that develops systematic high-quality software products using engineering principles, methods and tools.
    Its importance in the technological industry is that it helps in creation of applications and systems that power various aspects in our daily modern lifes. example is like applications that help in commumication which is a vital need in our daily lives

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Programming language - new programming languages such as c and fortran were introduce enhancing the software develpoment.
advent structructured programming. in the 1970s a structured programmming was introduced adressing the issues whereby prviously programs were written in an unorganized way usin goto statements.by the introduction of this structure it made code more pedictable easier to debug and simpler to understand.
rise of agile methodologies. previously traditional methods involved tones of documentation before one began coding, agile emphasized on flexibility collaboration and customer feedback solving this problem.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 Requirements - involves gathering and documenting user needs and sysytem requirements
 design - involves the creation of high level  and detailed design of software architecture and user interface
 implementation - involves writing code and building softwares to meets the design specifics
 deployment - involves taking the software to users or customers.
 mantainance - involves offering ongoing support, updates and enhancements of the deployed software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   both are used fo project management.
   waterfall follows a distinct sequencial phases that must be followed before proceeding to the next and is use well where the is clear with unchanging requirements e.g manufacturing while agile is iterative and flexible emphasisng on flexibilty and colaboration and is suitable where project need flexibilty and adaptability e.g software develpoment.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples in each
IDEs offer intergrated environments for writting, debugging and testing code e.g visual studio and eclipse on ther other hand VCS offer software tools for trackig changes made to source code and work coordition among teams thus enhancing productivity.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements, tight deadlines and technical debt.
strategies put in place to tackle these iclude effective communication,applying agile methodologies, task prioritization and regular reassencement.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing - testing components and modules as individual.
intergrated testing testing interaction between different components
system testing - testin4g system as a whole
acceptance - testing against the user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
this is crafting questions o statements to get best possible responses.
it helps avoid getting confussing anwers by helping make your questions more clear and specific'

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective
 VAGUE - How can i change my password in my phone.

 improved- help me be able to changeme android oppo phone password in a step by step guide skipping no important information.
